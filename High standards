Answer (a):
##3.2 Definition by ISO-27000:2020
Attack:
Attempt to destroy, expose, alter, disable, steal or gain unauthorized access to or make unauthorized
use of an asset.

My own explanation:
Basicly this standard means in practice: The information security in the organization needs to be at the level that no one can get unauthorized use of the assets and do anything with them. 
The standard is created to consider both outsiders and insiders.

##3.31 Definition by ISO-27000:2020
Information security incident
single or a series of unwanted or unexpected information security events (3.30) that have a significant
probability of compromising business operations and threatening information security (3.28)

My own explanation:
The standard 3.31 means that in organization there might be unnoticed or noticed information security gaps and there havn't been any actions to prevent them.
If the gaps are breached, then the organization is at risk to lose their advantage towards competitioners.
If the unexecpted information security events occur there must be fast reactions to correct them and make the harm as minimun as possible. 

##3.56 definition by ISO-27000:2020
Requirement
Need or expectation that is stated, generally implied or obligatory

My own explanation:
Requirements are needs in the organization in order to make organization more secure.
Through processes and negotiating with the team these requirements are decided and made into reality.
The importance of the requirements are listed as stated, generally implied or obligatory.

##3.58 definition by ISO-27000:2020
Review
Activity undertaken to determine the suitability, adequacy and effectiveness (3.20) of the subject matter
to achieve established objectives (3.49)

My own explanation:
In order to decide which actions are need to be made, organization must review different outcomes what the decision provides.
For example if the organization needs grant access to certain assets, how usefull and adequacy it really is.

##3.77 definition by ISO-27000:2020
Vulnerability
Weakness of an asset or control (3.14) that can be exploited by one or more threats (3.74)

My own explanation:
Vulnerability is a weakness in information security that exists.
If getting access to crusial information is easy through a loophole and if an attacker is using the loophole, then the organization is at risk.
