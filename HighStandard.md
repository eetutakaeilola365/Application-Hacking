# Homework 1

## A:
Task:
Familiarize yourself with the glossary defined in the SFS-EN ISO/IEC 27000:2020 standard, Chapter 3: Terms and Definitions.
Investigate the definitions of the following sections and explain in your own words what they mean: 3.2, 3.31, 3.56, 3.58, 3.77.
## 3.2 Definition by ISO-27000:2020
Attack:
Attempt to destroy, expose, alter, disable, steal or gain unauthorized access to or make unauthorized
use of an asset.

My own explanation:
In practice this standard means: The information security in the software needs to be at the level that no one can get unauthorized use of the assets and do anything with them. 

## 3.31 Definition by ISO-27000:2020
Information security incident
single or a series of unwanted or unexpected information security events (3.30) that have a significant
probability of compromising business operations and threatening information security (3.28)

My own explanation:
The standard 3.31 means that in software there might be unnoticed or noticed information security gaps and there havn't been any actions to prevent them.
If the gaps are breached, then the organization is at risk to lose their advantage towards competitioners.
If the unexecpted information security events occur there must be fast reactions to correct them and make the harm as minimun as possible. 

## 3.56 definition by ISO-27000:2020
Requirement
Need or expectation that is stated, generally implied or obligatory

My own explanation:
Requirements are needs in the software in order to make software more secure.
Through processes and negotiating with the team these requirements are decided and made into reality.
The importance of the requirements are listed as stated, generally implied or obligatory.

## 3.58 definition by ISO-27000:2020
Review
Activity undertaken to determine the suitability, adequacy and effectiveness (3.20) of the subject matter
to achieve established objectives (3.49)

My own explanation:
In order to decide which actions are need to be made, organization must review different outcomes what the decision provides.
For example if the organization needs grant access to certain assets, how usefull and adequacy it really is.

## 3.77 definition by ISO-27000:2020
Vulnerability
Weakness of an asset or control (3.14) that can be exploited by one or more threats (3.74)

My own explanation:
Vulnerability is a weakness in information security that exists.
If getting access to crusial information is easy through a loophole and if an attacker is using the loophole, then the organization is at risk.


## B:
Task:
Familiarize yourself with the ISO 27034-1 to 5 standards. Determine what the overall standard framework entails.

Answer:
Parts 1-5 of the ISO 27034 standard address application security, specifically focusing on how it should be 
incorporated into processes, organizational practices, application development, trust assessment, and release aspects.

When developing an application, risk assessments are conducted within the frameworks of information security, the organization, and processes. 
This type of assessment, supported by ISO 27034 standards, helps the organization develop a reliable and purpose-built application that benefits the organization economically.

## C:
Task:
Listen to the podcast: Meurman 2021: Laatulöpinät 30: Information Security in Software Development (episode mp3, Laatulöpinät RSS feed).
What is your opinion on the claims made in the podcast? (No technical testing on a computer required)

Answer:
In the podcast Markus Meurman was intervewed a guest named Joona Kokkola.
Kokkola was answering to the statements asked by Meurman and the main points he made was:

1. if human was designing information security, the information security will have some faults and
humanmade is never perfect. I think this is correct but I was wondering if AI was doing the security
for software and not human, will it be perfect then. For example if you input all the linux penetration commands
to the AI and test the software with them and then you change the system in a way that the AI isn't able to get in,
will it then be perfect.

 2. From user point of view, how  to make the software usable and user friendly and secure.
There is some challenges to combinne these factors and I think the software is more perfect if these factors
are equally considered.

3. The developer of the software isn't confident that the information security is enough in the software.
Joona was answering that the developer is more aware to the risks the software might have but in the same time
he doesn't think anyone's else softwares have any vulnerabilities. This makes the developer insecure and I think
the software's manufacturing process might take longer time to finish when you always have to think if I missed something important. 

## D:
Task: Download Linux Debian to your computer

Answer:
I have already downloaded Kali Linux to my PC and I believe I can finish my future work using that.
